# 100-days-of-flutter rules
START DATE: 10-02-2022
1. I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
3. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
4. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
5. I will update the [Log](https://github.com/saurabhtopthon01/100-days-of-flutter/blob/main/Resources/Logs.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
6. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
